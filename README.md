CHT Android App
===============

The cht-android application is a thin Android wrapper to load the [CHT Core Framework](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/) web application in a Webview native container.

The repository contains “flavored” configurations, where each “flavor” or “brand” is an app. This allows the application to be hardcoded to a specific CHT deployment and have a partner specific logo and display name. The app also provides some deeper integration with other android apps and native phone functions that are otherwise unavailable to webapps.
