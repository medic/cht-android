CHT Android App
===============

The cht-android application is a thin wrapper to load the [CHT Core Framework](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/) web application in a webview. This allows the application to be hardcoded to a specific CHT deployment and have a partner specific logo and display name. This app also provides some deeper integration with other android apps and native phone functions that are otherwise unavailable to webapps.


# APKs

For compatibility with a wide range of devices the build script produces multiple APKs. The two variables are the instruction set used by the device's CPU, and the supported Android version. When publishing to the Google Play Store upload all APKs and it will automatically choose the right one for the target device. However, when sideloading the application it is essential to pick the correct APK or the application may crash.

To help you pick which APK to install you can find information about the version of Android and the CPU in the About section of the phone's settings menu.

The APKs are named as follows: `cht-android-{version}-{brand}-{rendering-engine}-{instruction-set}-release.apk`

| Rendering engine | Instruction set | Android version | Notes                                                       |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `webview`        | `arm64-v8a`     | 10+             | Preferred. Use this APK if possible.                        |
| `webview`        | `armeabi-v7a`   | 10+             | Built but not compatible with any devices. Ignore this APK. |
| `xwalk`          | `arm64-v8a`     | 4.4 - 9         |                                                             |
| `xwalk`          | `armeabi-v7a`   | 4.4 - 9         |                                                             |


# Release notes

## 0.8.0

### Changes

- [improvement] [#163](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/issues/163) New connection errors UX:
  - The improvements only apply to _Webview_ flavors.
  - It also applies when the app migrates to Webview from a XWalk installation.
- [improvement] [#134](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/issues/134) New UX of Crosswalk to Webview migration:
  - Add splash screen while the data is migrated.
  - Fix bug that caused redirect to the login page after migrate.
- [improvement] Remove unused `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` from the `cmmb_kenya` and `surveillance_covid19_kenya` flavors

You can see more about these changes in the release notes for [CHT Core v3.11.0](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/release-notes/docs/3.11.0.md)

## 0.7.3

### Changes

- [improvement] [cht-android#148](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/issues/148): Remove storage access for most flavors that don't use the permission
- [improvement] New flavors added, and "livinggoods_innovation_ke" removed
- [improvement] Add new translations for the prominent disclosure for location access: Tagalog (tel), Illonggo (hil), and Bisaya (ceb), and fixed translation string for the disclosure in Nepal (ne)

### Notes

A new flavor `unbranded_test` was added with the storage permission removed for testing, while `unbranded` flavor keeps the permission from the global manifest.

## 0.7.0

### Changes

- [feature] [cht-android#136](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/issues/136): Add UI for prominent disclosure when requesting location permissions.

### Notes

The text used in the new location permission request is in the Android wrapper app itself (`cht-android`), and translated differently than [CHT Core labels](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/translations/). Any additions or modifications to translations in `cht-android` are done in the `strings.xml` files according to the [Android localization framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization).


## 0.6.0

### Upgrade notes

This release is largely intended to unblock the publishing of new apps onto the Google Play Store in a manner compatible with Android 10+. This release includes a difficult upgrade experience which may cause operational challenges in the field for apps with users on Android 10+. In particular:

1. When loading the application after upgrade you will need an internet connection in order to cache the application code.
2. The migration can take a few minutes to complete so after upgrade the user may be shown a login screen. If this happens, restart the application periodically until the user is logged in and the app loads as per usual.

We are planning improvements to [make the migration more user friendly](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/issues/134) in a future release.

Users on Android 9 and below do not need to be migrated and will be unaffected by this change. Because of this it is recommended that projects upgrade to v0.6.0 version of their app before issuing Android 10+ devices, if possible.

Earlier releases are no longer accepted by the Google Play Store.

### Changes

- [improvement] [cht-android#106](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/issues/106): Update target SDK version to 29 for Play Store compliance.

## 0.5.0

### Upgrade notes

This release changes the way in which location data is collected to better align with Play Store policies. Now the information is gathered only when filling in a form as opposed to as soon as the app is loaded.

*Note*: This breaks backwards compatibility with older versions of the CHT Core Framework which may mean that location data is no longer collected at all. It is recommended you upgrade to CHT v3.9.2 or later before upgrading the android app.

### Changes

- [feature] [cht-core#6380](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6380): Adds intent so opening deployment URLs will prompt to load in app
- [improvement] [cht-android#111](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/issues/111): Compliance with Play Store developer policies for PII collection disclosure
- [bug] [cht-core#6648](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6648): Blank screen when launching external apps from CHT Android app


# Development

1. Install the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools) and Java 8+ (it works with the OpenJDK versions).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Plug in your phone. Check it's detected with `adb devices`.
4. Execute: `make` (will also push app into the phone). Use `make xwalk` for the Xwalk version instead.

Gradle is also used but it's downloaded and installed in the user space the first time `make` is executed.

You can also build and launch the app with [Android Studio](#android-studio).

## Flavor selection

Some `make` targets support the flavor and the rendering engine as `make flavor=[Flavor][Engine] [task]`, where `[Flavor]` is the branded version with the first letter capitalized and the `[Engine]` is either `Webview` or `Xwalk`. The `[task]` is the action to execute: `deploy`, `assemble`, `lint`, etc.

The default value for `flavor` is `UnbrandedWebview`, e.g. executing `make deploy` will assemble and install that flavor, while executing `make flavor=MedicmobilegammaXwalk deploy` will do the same for the _Medicmobilegamma_ brand and the `Xwalk` engine.

See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for more details.

## Build and assemble

    $ make assemble

The command above builds and assembles the _debug_ and _release_ APKs of the Unbranded Webview version of the app.

Each APK will be generated and stored in `build/outputs/apk/[flavor][Engine]/[debug|release]/`, for example after assembling the _Simprints Webview_ flavor with `make flavor=SimprintsWebview assemble`, the _release_ versions of the APKs generated are stored in `build/outputs/apk/simprintsWebview/release/`.

To assemble other flavors, use the following command: `make flavour=[Flavor][Engine] assemble`. See the [Flavor selection](#flavor-selection) section for more details about `make` commands.

To clean the APKs and compiled resources: `make clean`.

## Static checks

To only execute the **linter checks**, run: `make lint`. To perform the same checks for the _XView_ source code, use: `make flavor=UnbrandedXwalk lint` instead.

## Testing

To execute unit tests: `make test` (static checks ara also executed).

### Instrumentation Tests (UI Tests)

These tests run on your device.

1. Uninstall previous versions of the app, otherwise an `InstallException: INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE` can make the tests fail.
2. Select English as default language in the app.
3. Execute steps 1 to 3 from [Development](#development).
4. Execute: `make test-ui` or `make test-ui-gamma`.

### Connecting to the server locally

Refer to the [CHT Core Developer Guide](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#testing-locally-with-devices).

## Android Studio

The [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) can be used to build and launch the app instead. Be sure to select the right flavor and rendering engine from the _Build Variants_ dialog (see [Build and run your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/run)). To launch the app in an emulator, you need to uncomment the code that has the strings for the `x86` or the `x86_64` architecture in the `android` / `splits` / `include` sections of the `build.gradle` file.


# Branding

## Building branded apps

To build and deploy APKs for all configured brands:

	$ make branded

## Adding new brands

To add a new brand:

1. add `productFlavors { <new_brand> { ... } }` in `build.gradle`.
2. add icons, strings etc. in `src/<new_brand>`.
3. to enable automated deployments, add the `new_brand` to `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.


# Releasing

## Alpha for release testing

1. Make sure all issues for this release have passed AT and been merged into `master`.
2. Create a git tag starting with `v` and ending with the alpha version, e.g. `v1.2.3-alpha.1` and push the tag to GitHub.
3. Creating this tag will trigger [GitHub Action](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/actions) to build, sign, and properly version the build. The release-ready APKs are available for side-loading from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/releases).
4. Announce the release in #quality-assurance.

## Final for users

1. Create a git tag starting with `v`, e.g. `v1.2.3` and push the tag to GitHub. 
2. The exact same process as Step 3 above.
3. Publish the unbranded, simprints, and gamma flavors to the Play Store.
4. Announce the release on the [CHT forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org), under the "Product - Releases" category.
5. Each flavor is then individually released to users via "Release Management" in the Google Play Console. Once a flavor has been tested and is ready to go live, click Release to Production.
