	* Outcome of validating a scanned QR payload: accepted, or rejected with a code and a detail.
	*
	* The code is what crosses the bridge, so it is a stable token the webapp turns into a
	* translated message. The detail is the prose behind it and is for the log only: a sentence
	* built here can never be translated, and would reach a CHW as raw text.
	*
	* Deliberately local to the QR pairing code. An earlier iteration reused the document-scope
	* classification result for this, which tied pairing to a data model it has nothing to do with.
